# Compressor_Decompressor
This project is a Java-based application that allows users to compress and decompress files, images, or documents using the Gzip algorithm. The graphical user interface was developed using Java Swing, and the core functionality was implemented using Java's inbuilt FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, and Gzip libraries.

# Features
1. Compress files: Users can select a file or document using the JFile chooser and compress it using the Gzip algorithm. The compressed file is saved in the same location as the original file with the ".gz" extension.
2. Decompress files: Users can select a compressed file using the JFile chooser and decompress it using the Gzip algorithm. The decompressed file is saved in the same location as the compressed file without the ".gz" extension.

# Technologies Used
1. Java: Used for the core coding of the application.
2. Java Swing: Used for developing the graphical user interface.
3. FileInputStream: Used for reading data from a file or document.
4. FileOutputStream: Used for writing data to a file or document.
5. Gzip: Used for compressing and decompressing files and documents.

# How to Use
To use the application, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone <repo-url>
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans)
3. Run the application by executing the Main.java file
4. Click on the "Choose file" button to select the file or document you want to compress or decompress.
5. Click on the "Compress" button to compress the selected file or document. The compressed file will be saved in the same location with the ".gz" extension.
6. Click on the "Decompress" button to decompress the selected file or document. The decompressed file will be saved in the same location without the ".gz" extension.
